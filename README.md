# MMTP: Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program

In response to the ongoing opioid crisis, effective treatment programs are critical for helping individuals achieve and sustain recovery. In this project, our aim is to develop a Methadone Mainteinance Treatment Program, using Python, designed specifically for clinicians as the end-users to assist those struggling with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD).

OUD is a substance use disorder, sometimes referred to as "opioid abuse or dependence" or "opioid addiction" and is a problematic pattern of opioid use that causes significant impairment or distress. It is a treatable, chronic disease that can affect anyone – regardless of race, gender, income level, or social class.

Methadone is a long-acting, synthetic opioid agonist and is widely used for its effectiveness in eliminating withdrawal symptoms and relieving drug cravings. It works by acting on the same opioid receptors that other opioids activate. Examples of other opioids include: heroin, morphine, codeine, fentanyl, oxycodone.

In the program, patients work with their clinicians to gradually reduce and/or maintain their methadone dosage that effectively prevents withdrawal.

Our program will serve as a tool to collect and organize patient information into a secure database, track methadone dosages, previous opioid type, duration of previous opioid use, and measure both patient retention rates and overall effectiveness of the treatment.

By using tools like NumPy and Pandas, our program will analyze trends and correlations in the collected data, providing valuable insights that can assist clinicians in making treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. We will focus on patient retention rate as dropout from maintenance programs places patients in high risk of relapse. Although relapse is a normal step in recovery, it may be life-threatening due to increased risk for a fatal overdose.

This project not only enhances the clinical management of OUD but also contributes to the large effort of addressing the opioid pandemic.
